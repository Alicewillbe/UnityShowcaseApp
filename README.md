# UnityShowcaseApp
A simple web app to focus on one project picked from MadeWithUnity showcase and show any available content for that project.

## other requirements
1. Each time refreshing the broswer, should show a different project from previous viewing

Ideally, we want a single user to see all n projects if he refresh the main page for n times. The problem is how can we remember the user to show them different content each time and somehow remember what each user viewed previously?

To do that, we might need to implement feature for session.

2. all contents are referenced from the external sources
